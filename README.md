# gravitationalWavesULL
Here is the code we used for the presentation "Ondas gravitacionales: ondas en el espacio tiempo" in the University of La Laguna on April 2024. The majority of the code can be found here: https://github.com/gwosc-tutorial/Data_Guide/blob/master/Guide_Notebook.ipynb, we added some snippets of code and spanish subtitles to make easier the understanding of the code for those not familiar with the field of study (gravitational waves and signal treatment) as well as another funtion to measure the quality of the data without the noise.
