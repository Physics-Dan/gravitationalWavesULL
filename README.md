# gravitationalWavesULL
Here is the code we used for the presentation "Ondas gravitacionales: ondas en el espacio tiempo" in the University of La Laguna on April 2024. The majority of the code can be found here: https://github.com/gwosc-tutorial/Data_Guide/blob/master/Guide_Notebook.ipynb, we added more and spanish subtitles to make easier the understanding of the code for those not fmiliar with the field of study (adnvanced wave manipulation physics) as well as a function to make easier choosing between different events captured from the LIGO observatory.
